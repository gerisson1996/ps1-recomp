# PS1Recomp

**Static recompiler for PlayStation 1 games -- translates MIPS R3000A machine code to native C++ for PC.**

## Overview

PS1Recomp converts PS1 game binaries into native PC executables through static recompilation. Instead of interpreting each MIPS instruction at runtime like a traditional emulator, it translates the entire game binary to C++ at compile time and links it against a hardware simulation runtime. The result is a standalone native executable that runs at full CPU speed.

## Building

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install cmake build-essential libsdl2-dev libgl-dev

# macOS
brew install cmake sdl2
```

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Dellareti/ps1-recomp.git
cd ps1-recomp
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### Build with GUI Studio (optional)

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPS1RECOMP_BUILD_INTERFACE=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/ps1Interface/ps1Interface
```

ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -j$(nproc)
```

## Running a Game (Rayman example)

> **Note:** Game disc images (ROMs/ISOs) are not included in this repository for legal
> reasons. You need your own legal copy of the game. The disc path is configured per-game
> and can point to **any folder on your system** -- there is no required directory name.

1. Place your disc image anywhere and note the path:
   ```
   # Example paths -- use whatever works for you:
   /home/user/games/Rayman (USA).cue
   ~/roms/Rayman (USA).cue
   ./my_games/Rayman (USA).cue
   ```

2. Analyze the binary and generate config:
   ```bash
   ./build/ps1Analyzer/ps1Analyzer "/path/to/Rayman (USA) (Track 01).bin.boot.exe" rayman_config.toml
   ```

3. Edit `rayman_config.toml` to set your disc path:
   ```toml
   [disc]
   cue_path = "/path/to/Rayman (USA).cue"
   ```

4. Recompile MIPS -> C++:
   ```bash
   ./build/ps1Recomp/ps1Recomp rayman_config.toml ps1Runtime/src/recompiled_out.cpp
   ```

5. Build and run:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
   ./build/ps1Runtime/ps1Runtime --config rayman_config.toml
   ```

## Controls

The keyboard stands in for a PS1 digital pad. The runtime prints this table on
startup, so it is always visible in the log of a run.

| Keyboard | PS1 pad | Keyboard | PS1 pad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arrow keys | D-Pad | <kbd>Q</kbd> | L1 |
| <kbd>Z</kbd> | Cross | <kbd>W</kbd> | R1 |
| <kbd>X</kbd> | Circle | <kbd>E</kbd> | L2 |
| <kbd>A</kbd> | Square | <kbd>R</kbd> | R2 |
| <kbd>S</kbd> | Triangle | <kbd>C</kbd> | L3 |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Start | <kbd>V</kbd> | R3 |
| <kbd>Right Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> | Select | <kbd>Esc</kbd> | quit |

Each press is echoed to stderr as `[pad] <key> -> <button>`, which separates a
button that reached the pad from one that never got there.

### Memory cards

Two cards are created under `memcards/` on first run, 128 KB each and formatted
as a real card is. Set `[paths] memcard_dir` in the game config to put them
somewhere else. A written sector is flushed to the file immediately, because
shutdown skips destructors and a deferred write would be lost.

## How It Works

### Phase 1 -- Analysis (`ps1Analyzer`)
- Reads the disc image (ISO 9660 / CUE+BIN) and extracts the PS1 executable
- Parses ELF sections: `.text` (MIPS code), `.data`, `.bss`
- Detects function boundaries via prologue patterns and call graph analysis
- Identifies PsyQ middleware calls via signature matching
- Outputs a TOML config with all function addresses and BSS layout

### Phase 2 -- Recompilation (`ps1Recomp`)
- Decodes every MIPS R3000A instruction (32-bit fixed-width)
- Emits equivalent C++ for each instruction using a `recomp_context` struct as register file
- Detects jump tables (switch statements) via LUI+ADDIU+ADDU+LW+JR pattern
- Handles GTE coprocessor instructions separately via `gte_emitter`
- Produces a single `recompiled_out.cpp` with one C++ function per MIPS function

### Phase 3 -- Runtime (`ps1Runtime`)
- **BIOS HLE**: implements PS1 syscall tables A/B/C without a BIOS ROM
- **GPU**: interprets GP0/GP1 commands, rasterizes polygons/lines/rectangles into VRAM (1024x512), renders via OpenGL 3.3 shader
- **CD-ROM**: emulates drive state machine, reads sectors from CUE/BIN files via ISO 9660
- **SPU**: 24-voice ADPCM audio, mixed via SDL2 audio callback
- **DMA**: transfers between RAM, GPU, SPU, MDEC, and CD-ROM
- **GTE**: geometry transform engine for 3D vertex processing
- **PsyQ HLE**: replaces PsyQ middleware functions (VSync, DrawSync, DrawOTag, SetDefDispEnv, PutDispEnv, PutDrawEnv) with native implementations

### GUI Studio (`ps1Interface`)
- **Explorer panel**: lists all functions with color-coded strategy (PsyQ=yellow, Stub=red, Skip=gray, ForceRecompile=green), filterable by name
- **Inspector panel**: shows function details (address, size, disassembly summary) and lets you change the recompilation strategy per function
- **Workspace panel**: tabbed view with C++ preview, hex dump, config.toml editor, and Ghidra CSV importer
- **Logs panel**: real-time analysis progress bar and error markers
- Keyboard shortcuts: `F5` = Analyze, `Ctrl+O` = Open ELF, `Ctrl+S` = Save config

## Key Design Decisions

**Static vs. dynamic recompilation**: All translation happens at compile time -- no JIT, no interpreter loop. Game code runs as regular C++ function calls at native CPU speed.

**HLE over LLE**: BIOS and PsyQ middleware are implemented as High-Level Emulation (HLE) stubs rather than running the original ROM code. This avoids legal issues and simplifies the runtime.

**Hash-based PsyQ detection**: `ps1Analyzer` matches each function body against a SHA-256 database of PsyQ SDK functions extracted from 14 SDK versions (3463 signatures, 1943 unique after collision filtering). Detected functions are routed to native HLE implementations at runtime instead of being recompiled. This avoids per-game imperative patches and is the project's main divergence from prior PS1 recompilers.

**Double-buffered framebuffer**: PS1 games typically use double-buffering in VRAM (e.g. Buffer A at (0,0) rendered while Buffer B at (0,256) is displayed, swapping each VBlank at 60Hz). The runtime infers the active display window from the GPU command stream.

## Tooling

### GUI Studio
```bash
./build/ps1Interface/ps1Interface
```
Opens the visual studio for loading ELF files, exploring functions, editing game configs, and previewing the generated C++ output before running the full pipeline.

### Ghidra Integration
The project includes Ghidra scripts for static analysis validation:
- Install the `ghidra_psx_ldr` plugin (PSX-specific loader with GTE + PsyQ support)
- Run `tools/ghidra/ExportPS1Functions.py` inside Ghidra to export function boundaries to CSV
- Run `tools/ghidra/start_ghidra_mcp.sh` to start Ghidra with the MCP bridge on port 8080

### Automated Diagnostics
```bash
python3 tools/run_and_report.py --duration 15 --output /tmp/report.json
```
Runs the game for N seconds and outputs a JSON report with frame rate, VRAM pixel analysis, GPU command log, and CD-ROM callback counts.

## Status

The project is the subject of an ongoing undergraduate thesis. **It is not a finished
emulator** -- it is a recompiler whose architecture works end-to-end, plus a runtime that
covers enough of the PS1 hardware to boot real games. The current state, honestly:

- **Pipeline**: stable. Analyzer -> recompiler -> runtime -> native binary works for any PS1
  ELF/EXE. Stub-mode build (no ROM) is the CI baseline (557/557 tests green).
- **Rayman (USA)**: was the primary validation target through Phases 0-3. With prior
  imperative HLE patches it ran at ~59fps with correct VRAM content. Those patches were
  retired during open-source preparation; the regen-fresh path now relies entirely on the
  PsyQ hash-based HLE coverage and has a brightness gap (see `ISSUES.md` #2 -- not
  re-validated end-to-end since patch removal).
- **Crash Bandicoot 1 (USA)**: experimental but boots. Reaches the main game loop and
  runs the full PsyQ render pipeline (`DrawOTag` ~435 calls/sec, `MulMatrix` ~870/sec,
  `VSync` ~58 fps) with an env-gated workaround (`PS1_SKIP_31BF8=1`) that NOPs a GOOL
  state machine call which would otherwise hang in an unpopulated hash table walk.
  Permanent fix (porting the NS chunk subsystem) is the next roadmap item in
  `PLANNING.md`. The bypass keeps the engine running so we can study the next layer
  while the proper fix is in progress.
- **Other games**: not exercised yet. The architecture is meant to be game-agnostic; adding
  a new title is mostly a matter of providing a TOML config and running the analyzer.
