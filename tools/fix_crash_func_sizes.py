"""Correct function sizes the analyzer gets wrong for Crash Bandicoot.

`ps1Analyzer` discovers functions from JAL targets.  When a routine has two
entry points that share one body -- a common PsyQ libgte shape -- the second
entry is recorded as a new function and the first is truncated to end where it
begins.  Everything after that first instruction is silently dropped from the
recompiled output.

This is not cosmetic.  0x80042FEC is the libgte vector transform that
func_800180CC calls to fill a stack MATRIX's translation (`a1 = SP+44`).
Truncated to one instruction, the body stopped after `lwc2 $0,0(a0)`, so the
translation was never written; SetTransMatrix then loaded stale stack contents
(RAM pointers) into the GTE's TRX/TRY/TRZ, every RTPT saturated with SZ3 = 0,
and the game's own `if (FLAG < 0) skip polygon` discarded 100% of every actor's
geometry -- no Crash, no Naughty Dog doghouse or banner, no level trail.

Extents verified against the c1c reference decompilation (srczz/zz_42fec.h).

The real fix belongs in ps1Analyzer: an entry point discovered inside an
existing function must not shorten it.  Until then, `tools/regen_crash.sh`
runs this pass so a regeneration does not silently undo the correction.
