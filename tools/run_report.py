    Derived from the session rather than hardcoded, so an X11-only box gets
    x11 and a Wayland one gets wayland; an explicit SDL_VIDEODRIVER always
    wins, with a warning when it names a driver known to degrade the run.

    Deriving beats leaving the variable unset: with no override SDL picks x11
    even in a Wayland session whenever DISPLAY points at XWayland (verified
    here -- the runtime connects to @/tmp/.X11-unix/X1), so "let SDL choose"
    silently measures a different backend than the one the audit numbers were
    taken on.  Refuse outright when neither variable is set instead of
    printing numbers from a boot that never rendered; same signal as
    ps1Test/runtime/test_golden_frame.cpp, which skips on it.
