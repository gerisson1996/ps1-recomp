/**
 * @file psyq_state.h
 * @brief Centralised C++ home for PsyQ runtime state (Phase 2, Session 2.1).
 *
 * Until Phase 2, every piece of "PsyQ-side" state -- VBlank counter, CD sync /
 * ready bytes, sector-read bookkeeping, async callbacks, GPU swap callback,
 * DrawSync OT tracking -- lived in PS1 RAM at game-specific BSS addresses
 * declared in `[psyq_addresses]` of each game TOML.  That model needs the
 * recompiled binary to actually initialise those addresses, which broke on
 * Crash Bandicoot (`cd_data_cb` is never written from MIPS, so `bios.cpp`
 * INT1 never finds a callback to invoke and `dma2_count` stays at 2).
 *
 * `PsyqState` is the C++ replacement: a process-wide singleton holding all
 * the values the HLE layer used to poke into PS1 RAM.  It is created lazily
 * by `psyq_state()` and lives until program exit.
 *
 * **Phase 2 status (post-2.4):** every former BSS slot now lives here --
 * VSync counter (2.2), CD sync/ready bytes (2.3), CD sector bookkeeping +
 * callbacks + GPU swap callback + DrawSync OT slots (2.4).  The
 * `[psyq_addresses]` block has been removed from `rayman.toml`/`crash.toml`
 * and the `Bios::PsyqAddresses` struct deleted.

/**
 * @brief OT (ordering-table) status slots formerly tracked at
 *        `gpu_drawsync_base` / `gpu_drawsync_index_addr` in BSS.
 *
 * Each entry mirrors one double-buffered OT and holds the per-slot
 * "drawing complete" flag that PsyQ's DrawSync polls.  `count` equals the
 * number of slots in use (2 for typical double-buffering); `index` is the
 * current write slot.  Slots beyond `count` are unused.
 *
 * The struct is intentionally shallow -- Phase 2 only stores what the legacy
 * BSS layout stored.  `Bios::triggerVBlankEvent` stamps every active slot
 * with status == 2 (PsyQ "drawing complete") since the runtime GPU is
 * fully synchronous; future async-render work can refine to per-slot
 * atomics if needed.
