 * @brief PS1 BIOS HLE -- A0/B0/C0 syscall dispatch, event system, callback queue.
 *
 * `ps1::bios::Bios` is the High-Level Emulation of the PS1 kernel.  The
 * runtime contains no original Sony code; instead the three syscall tables
 * (A, B, C) are implemented as native C++ in `syscall_a.cpp`, `syscall_b.cpp`
 * and `syscall_c.cpp`, with file I/O, heap, and event-system helpers split
 * into their own translation units.
 *
 * Threading: most state is touched only from the game thread.  CDROM IRQs
 * arrive from the SDL render thread and are pushed onto a queue
 * (`queueCdromEvent`) that the game thread drains via
 * `drainPendingCallbacks` -- see Phase 3.3 for the rationale.
